The task is to build chart which represents the data from emotions.json file with JavaScript.
JSON has meta information and an array with session events. Each event has participant id (integer) and attention value (float).
The chart should show a line for each participant.
The X axis is minutes from the beginning of the session. The Y axis is the average attention per minute.
If there are no data for some minute the line in the chart should have a gap.

The example.jpg shows approximate result.

Bonus:
It's good to have smooth line and the ability to change the scale of X axis, for example, to show the values for each 10 seconds.
